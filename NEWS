News for Version 2.0.0
----------------------

- made the 'kill delay' an option

- longer grace period before killing the process again
  (added to allow solvers to dump state after being killed)

- internal hash table for processes
  (removes compile time dependency on maximum process ID)

- report current load and maximum load

- better default mount options in 'runlim-remount-proc'

- semantical version numbering scheme

- TAI-based time, i.e. changes to the system time (NTP or 
  daylight saving time) cannot influence a running benchmark

News for Version 1.22
---------------------

- automatically try to remount '/proc' file system

News for Version 1.13
---------------------

- added '--single' option

- more robust 'proc' and option parsing code

- completely reworked process tree organization

- closing 'log' if necessary
  (thanks to Viktor Schuppan)

- added '[runlim] host: ...' output

- remove limiting memory through 'setrlimit (RLIMIT_AS, ...'
